# Damages and Value Impact – 3530 Patterstone Dr

Tenant: Yoda Burns  
Landlord: Monisha [Last Name Unknown]  
Monthly Rent: $3,000  

---

## 1. Rent Abatement – Loss of Use of Bathrooms

### 1.1. Inputs

- Monthly rent (R): $3,000
- Portion of rental value lost due to two unusable bathrooms (P): estimate 50–60%
- Duration of loss of use (M): 4–5 months  
  - Mid-May 2025 to end of September 2025 (approx.)

### 1.2. Formula

\[
\text{Rent Abatement} = R \times P \times M
\]

### 1.3. Example Calculations

- Lower bound (50% loss, 4 months):

  \[
  3{,}000 \times 0.50 \times 4 = 6{,}000
  \]

- Upper bound (60% loss, 5 months):

  \[
  3{,}000 \times 0.60 \times 5 = 9{,}000
  \]

**Rent Abatement Range:** **$6,000 – $9,000** (to be refined with exact dates).

## 2. Repair and Remediation Costs

### 2.1. Scope

- Plumbing repair (upstairs bathroom leak).
- Restoration of upstairs children's bathroom (fixtures, finishes, drywall).
- Restoration of downstairs guest bathroom:
  - Ceiling.
  - Walls.
  - Any damaged flooring.
- Mold remediation:
  - Removal of mold-affected materials.
  - Cleaning, containment, and clearance.

### 2.2. Estimate Structure

Let:

- \( C_p \) = plumbing repair cost  
- \( C_u \) = upstairs bathroom restoration cost  
- \( C_d \) = downstairs bathroom restoration cost  
- \( C_m \) = mold remediation cost  

Then:

\[
\text{Total Repair Cost} = C_p + C_u + C_d + C_m
\]

Example band (to be replaced by actual quotes):

- \( C_p \approx \$1{,}500 – \$3{,}000 \)
- \( C_u \approx \$2{,}000 – \$5{,}000 \)
- \( C_d \approx \$2{,}000 – \$5{,}000 \)
- \( C_m \approx \$2{,}500 – \$7{,}000 \)

Approximate range:

- Low: \( 1{,}500 + 2{,}000 + 2{,}000 + 2{,}500 = 8{,}000 \)
- High: \( 3{,}000 + 5{,}000 + 5{,}000 + 7{,}000 = 20{,}000 \)

**Repair & Remediation Range:** **$8,000 – $20,000** (to be refined by contractor estimates).

## 3. Security Deposit

Let:

- Security deposit paid: \( D \) (insert actual amount, e.g. $3,000).

Landlord's breach and failure to maintain habitability:

- Eliminates basis to retain deposit for "tenant damage."
- Tenant seeks **full return**:

\[
\text{Deposit Refund} = D
\]

---

## 4. Guest Use / Loss of Enjoyment – Quantified Add-On

Downstairs guest bathroom unusable for guests and household:

Let:

- Guest-use loss factor (G): 10% of rent.
- Duration (M): 4–5 months.

Formula:

\[
\text{Guest Loss Add-On} = R \times G \times M
\]

Example:

- 4 months:

  \[
  3{,}000 \times 0.10 \times 4 = 1{,}200
  \]

- 5 months:

  \[
  3{,}000 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1{,}500
  \]

---

## 5. Overall Monetary Impact (Range)

Let:

- \( A \) = Rent Abatement  
- \( T \) = Total Repair Cost  
- \( D \) = Deposit Refund  
- \( G \) = Guest Loss Add-On  

Then:

\[
\text{Total Monetary Impact (excluding health)} = A + T + D + G
\]

Using midpoints:

- \( A \approx 7{,}500 \)
- \( T \approx 14{,}000 \) (midpoint of 8–20k)
- \( D \approx 3{,}000 \) (example)
- \( G \approx 1{,}350 \) (midpoint of 1,200–1,500)

\[
\text{Total} \approx 7{,}500 + 14{,}000 + 3{,}000 + 1{,}350 = 25{,}850
\]

**Indicative Total (excluding any health damages):** about **$20,000 – $40,000**, depending on final numbers.

---

## 6. Diminution of Rental Value (Conceptual)

During months of non-repair:

- Contracted rental value: $3,000/month.
- Effective usable value: significantly less due to:
  - Loss of two bathrooms.
  - Water damage and suspected mold.

Let:

- Contracted value: \( V_c = 3{,}000 \)
- Effective value during defect: \( V_e = V_c \times (1 - P) \), where \( P \approx 0.5 – 0.6 \).

Example (50% loss):

\[
V_e = 3{,}000 \times (1 - 0.50) = 1{,}500
\]

So, each defective month, Tenant is overpaying by:

\[
V_{\text{overpay}} = V_c - V_e = 3{,}000 - 1{,}500 = 1{,}500
\]

Over 4–5 months:

\[
\text{Overpay Total} = V_{\text{overpay}} \times M = 1{,}500 \times 4–5 = 6{,}000 – 7{,}500
\]

This aligns with the rent abatement range above.

## 7. Non-Monetary Harms (For Narrative / Non-Economic Heading)

- Children forced to share a single master bathroom with parents for months.
- Stress and disruption of school mornings.
- Embarrassment in hosting guests due to visible water damage and suspected mold.
- Ongoing anxiety about health risks from mold and chronic dampness.

(These are primarily qualitative but can support a request for broader damages under general negligence / bad faith.)
