## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

### A. The Lease and Initial Occupancy

6. In or around late November 2024, Plaintiff and Plaintiff's family entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant for the Property located at 3530 Patterstone Drive, Alpharetta, Georgia.

7. The lease provided for monthly rent in the amount of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00).

8. Plaintiff paid a security deposit to Defendant in the amount of $[INSERT AMOUNT] at the commencement of the lease.

9. The lease term was for twelve (12) months, scheduled to end in or around November 2025.

10. Plaintiff's household consisted of Plaintiff, Plaintiff's spouse, and two minor children, approximately twelve (12) and fourteen (14) years of age.

11. The Property is a single-family residence containing three (3) bathrooms:
    - A master bathroom;
    - An upstairs children's bathroom; and
    - A downstairs guest bathroom.

### B. The Leak and Initial Notice

12. In or around mid-May 2025, a leak developed in the upstairs children's bathroom, originating from the shower, tub, and/or associated plumbing.

13. Water from this leak traveled through the floor and ceiling assembly, causing water intrusion into the downstairs guest bathroom directly below.

14. In late May 2025, Plaintiff observed visible water damage, including:
    - Dampness in the upstairs children's bathroom;
    - Water staining on the ceiling and walls of the downstairs guest bathroom; and
    - Ongoing moisture intrusion.

15. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak via text message, describing:
    - The leak in the upstairs bathroom;
    - Water coming through the ceiling into the downstairs bathroom; and
    - A request that Defendant arrange for immediate repair.

16. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff's notice and indicated that someone would be sent to address the issue.

### C. Defendant's Inadequate Response

17. In early June 2025 (approximately June 1–2, 2025), Defendant sent an individual described as a handyman or maintenance person to inspect the Property.

18. This individual was not a licensed plumber.

19. The individual opened part of the ceiling in the downstairs bathroom to inspect the plumbing but informed Plaintiff that:
    - He did not have the proper tools to complete the repair;
    - He was not qualified to perform the necessary plumbing work; and
    - The issue required a licensed professional plumber.

20. No licensed plumber was sent by Defendant.

21. No permanent repair of the leak was completed at that time.

22. Throughout June 2025, Plaintiff sent multiple follow-up messages to Defendant, including:
    - Reports that the leak persisted and that using the upstairs bathroom would cause further water damage downstairs;
    - Requests for a qualified, licensed plumber; and
    - Requests for a comprehensive repair plan.

23. Defendant failed to send a licensed plumber or other qualified professional to repair the underlying plumbing defect.

### D. Tear-Out Without Repair

24. In or around mid-July 2025, Defendant sent or authorized an unlicensed individual (handyman) to return to the Property.

25. This individual performed the following work:
    - Tore out sections of the ceiling and/or wall in the downstairs bathroom to expose plumbing and framing; and
    - Cut away some water-damaged materials.

26. This individual did **not**:
    - Repair or replace the underlying plumbing defect causing the leak;
    - Perform professional mold remediation on water-damaged materials;
    - Systematically remove, dry, or replace water-damaged porous materials (drywall, insulation, etc.) within the critical 24–72 hour window recommended by EPA, CDC, and FEMA guidance; or
    - Close or finish the opened areas.

27. After this incomplete work, the downstairs guest bathroom was left with:
    - An open, torn-out ceiling exposing framing and pipes;
    - Visible water staining and damage; and
    - No functional repair.

28. The upstairs children's bathroom plumbing remained unrepaired, such that any use of that bathroom would continue to cause water to leak into the downstairs area.

### E. Loss of Use of Two Bathrooms

29. Following the failed repair attempts, Plaintiff and Plaintiff's family were forced to **cease all use** of:
    - The upstairs children's bathroom (including shower, tub, and sinks); and
    - The downstairs guest bathroom (which remained torn open, water-damaged, and unsanitary).

30. From approximately July 2025 through at least September 2025, Plaintiff's household of four (4) persons—two adults and two minor children—was limited to using only the master bathroom.

31. This caused significant daily hardship and disruption, including:
    - Minor children required to wake earlier for school to share a single bathroom with parents;
    - Inability to accommodate guests due to the unusable and visibly damaged guest bathroom;
    - Crowding and stress during morning routines; and
    - General loss of the benefit of a three-bathroom home for which Plaintiff was paying $3,000 per month.

### F. Mold and Water Damage

32. Throughout the period from June 2025 through September 2025, the downstairs bathroom exhibited:
    - Brown and yellow water staining on ceilings and walls;
    - Evidence of ongoing moisture exposure and dampness;
    - Open cavities in the ceiling left exposed after the tear-out; and
    - Dark discoloration consistent with mold growth in and around water-damaged areas.

33. Plaintiff observed and reported to Defendant the presence of suspected **black mold** in the water-damaged areas.

34. Defendant **failed** to:
    - Hire a qualified, licensed mold remediation contractor;
    - Document or implement any drying, containment, or HEPA filtration protocol;
    - Remove or replace mold-contaminated porous materials; or
    - Take any meaningful steps to remediate the mold hazard.

35. These conditions persisted for months, exposing Plaintiff and Plaintiff's minor children to potential health hazards associated with mold and chronic moisture.

### G. Defendant's Failure to Respond

36. Between June 2025 and September 2025, Plaintiff sent **repeated written messages** to Defendant via text and other communication channels, including but not limited to:
    - Reports of ongoing water damage and unusable bathrooms;
    - Reports of suspected black mold;
    - Requests for a licensed plumber and qualified mold remediation contractor;
    - Requests for full restoration of the bathrooms; and
    - Requests for a timeline and plan for repairs.

37. Defendant frequently **failed to respond** to Plaintiff's messages.

38. When Defendant did respond, Defendant failed to provide:
    - A licensed plumber;
    - A qualified mold remediation specialist;
    - A meaningful repair schedule; or
    - Any other effective action to restore habitability.

### H. Plaintiff's Continued Payment of Rent

39. Despite the loss of use of two out of three bathrooms and the presence of ongoing water damage and suspected mold, Plaintiff continued to pay rent to Defendant in the amount of $3,000 per month, on time and in full, including all payments for:
    - May 2025
    - June 2025
    - July 2025
    - August 2025
    - September 2025

40. Plaintiff made these payments in good faith, hoping that Defendant would fulfill Defendant's legal obligation to repair the Property.

### I. Constructive Eviction and Termination

41. By late September 2025, it became clear that Defendant would not remedy the uninhabitable conditions.

42. The Property had become uninhabitable due to:
    - Loss of two functional bathrooms for a family of four;
    - Ongoing water damage and suspected mold presenting health and safety risks; and
    - Defendant's months-long failure to perform necessary repairs.

43. Plaintiff was constructively evicted from the Property by Defendant's breach of the duty to maintain habitable premises.

44. Plaintiff elected to terminate the tenancy and vacate the Property [insert date if available, e.g., September 30, 2025 or end of lease term].

45. Plaintiff provided Defendant with written notice of Plaintiff's intent to terminate the lease and demand for return of the security deposit and compensation for damages.

46. Defendant has failed to return Plaintiff's security deposit in full or provide any compensation for the damages and losses suffered.
