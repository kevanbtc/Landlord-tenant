## II. BACKGROUND AND FACTUAL SUMMARY

### A. The Lease
- **Lease Term:** November 2024 – November 2025 (12 months)
- **Monthly Rent:** $3,000.00
- **Security Deposit:** $[INSERT AMOUNT]
- **Property Type:** Single-family residence, 3 bathrooms
- **Occupants:** Myself, my spouse, and two minor children (ages approximately 12 and 14)

### B. My Performance Under the Lease
I have been a **model tenant**:
- ✅ **Every rent payment made ON TIME** – Never once late in 12 months
- ✅ **Every rent payment made IN FULL** – Always the full $3,000
- ✅ **No tenant-caused damage** – Property maintained in good condition
- ✅ **Immediate reporting of issues** – Notified you promptly when problems arose
- ✅ **Multiple good-faith attempts to work with you** – Gave you months to remedy

**Total rent paid to date: $[X × $3,000] = $[INSERT TOTAL]**

### C. Your Breach and Misconduct

#### 1. The Leak (May 2025)
In mid-May 2025, a **plumbing leak** developed in the upstairs children's bathroom. Water traveled through the floor/ceiling assembly and caused intrusion into the downstairs guest bathroom.

#### 2. My Immediate Notice to You
In **late May 2025**, I notified you via text message of:
- The leak in the upstairs bathroom
- Water coming through the ceiling into the downstairs bathroom
- The need for immediate professional repair

**You acknowledged receipt of this notice.**

#### 3. Your Inadequate Response – June 2025
In early June 2025, you sent an **unqualified handyman** (not a licensed plumber) to inspect. He:
- Opened part of the ceiling
- Told me he **did not have the proper tools**
- Told me he **was not qualified** to do the work
- Told me the job required a **licensed professional plumber**

**You never sent a licensed plumber.** The leak was never properly repaired.

#### 4. My Repeated Follow-Up Notices – June 2025
Throughout June 2025, I sent you **multiple follow-up messages** reporting:
- The leak was still active
- Using the upstairs bathroom would cause water to continue pouring into the downstairs bathroom
- Both bathrooms were becoming unusable
- I needed you to send a qualified professional immediately

**You ignored these requests and failed to hire a licensed plumber.**

#### 5. Incomplete and Damaging "Repair" – July 2025
In mid-July 2025, you sent an individual (again, not a licensed professional) who:
- **Tore out sections of the ceiling and walls** in the downstairs bathroom
- **Exposed framing and pipes**
- **Did NOT repair the underlying plumbing leak**
- **Did NOT remediate water damage or mold**
- **Did NOT complete the work or close up the opened areas**

After this "repair," the Property was in **worse condition** than before:
- Open ceiling with exposed pipes and framing
- Water-damaged materials left in place
- Visible staining and suspected **black mold**
- Both upstairs and downstairs bathrooms **completely unusable**

#### 6. Complete Loss of Two Bathrooms – July-September 2025
From July 2025 through September 2025 (and continuing), my family and I were **forced to stop using**:
- The upstairs children's bathroom (shower, tub, sinks)
- The downstairs guest bathroom (torn open, water-damaged, mold-contaminated)

**My household of four people – two adults and two minor children – had access to only ONE bathroom (the master bathroom) for approximately 5 months.**

**This caused severe hardship:**
- My children had to wake up earlier for school to coordinate bathroom time
- We could not have guests visit due to the embarrassing and unsanitary conditions
- Daily stress, crowding, and disruption
- We were paying $3,000/month for a 3-bathroom home but could only use 1 bathroom

#### 7. Suspected Black Mold and Health Hazards – June-September 2025
The downstairs bathroom exhibited:
- Brown and yellow water staining on ceilings and walls
- Dark discoloration consistent with **black mold**
- Open cavities in the ceiling exposing damp, damaged materials
- Evidence of ongoing moisture and microbial growth

**I reported the suspected mold to you multiple times.** You:
- ❌ Never hired a certified mold remediation company
- ❌ Never conducted mold testing
- ❌ Never implemented proper drying, containment, or HEPA protocols
- ❌ Left water-damaged porous materials (drywall, insulation) in place for months

**This violated EPA, CDC, and FEMA guidance**, which require:
- Drying within 24-48 hours
- Removal of wet porous materials
- Professional remediation for visible mold

**You knowingly exposed my minor children to potential respiratory and health hazards for months.**

#### 8. Your Refusal to Communicate – August-September 2025
I sent you **repeated written messages** throughout August and September 2025, including:
- Reports of ongoing unusable bathrooms
- Reports of suspected black mold and health concerns
- Requests for licensed professionals
- Requests for a repair timeline

**You frequently failed to respond at all.** On at least one occasion (beginning of September 2025), I sent a detailed message explaining the conditions and requesting immediate action. **You never responded.**

#### 9. You Continued to Accept My $3,000 Monthly Rent
Despite full knowledge that the Property was uninhabitable, **you continued to cash my rent checks every month**:
- ✅ May 2025: $3,000 – You knew about the leak
- ✅ June 2025: $3,000 – You knew bathrooms were unusable
- ✅ July 2025: $3,000 – You knew about water damage and mold
- ✅ August 2025: $3,000 – You knew conditions were worsening
- ✅ September 2025: $3,000 – You knew my family was suffering

**You accepted at least $15,000 in rent while providing a property that was substantially uninhabitable.**

**You spent $0 on hiring licensed professionals to fix the problems.**

---

## III. YOUR LEGAL VIOLATIONS

### A. Breach of O.C.G.A. § 44-7-13 (Statutory Duty to Repair)
Georgia law imposes a **non-waivable statutory duty** on landlords to keep leased premises in repair. You breached this duty by:
- Failing to repair the plumbing leak
- Failing to properly restore the water-damaged bathrooms
- Failing to remediate mold
- Sending unqualified workers who made the situation worse
- Allowing two critical bathrooms to remain unusable for months

### B. Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability
You breached the implied warranty of habitability by:
- Rendering the Property unfit for its intended residential use
- Depriving my family of functional bathrooms
- Allowing water damage, mold, and unsanitary conditions to persist

### C. Constructive Eviction
Your failure to maintain habitable conditions **constructively evicted me** from the Property. I was forced to choose between:
- Living in unsafe, unhealthy conditions, or
- Terminating the lease and moving out

This constitutes constructive eviction under Georgia law.

### D. Negligence
You breached your duty of reasonable care by:
- Failing to hire licensed, qualified professionals despite being told they were needed
- Failing to implement timely water damage remediation (within 24-48 hours)
- Allowing mold to grow and spread for months
- Exposing my minor children to health hazards

### E. Bad Faith Conduct (O.C.G.A. § 13-6-11)
Your conduct demonstrates **textbook bad faith**, including:
1. Ignoring **multiple written notices** spanning several months
2. Sending unqualified workers after being explicitly told they were unqualified
3. Accepting $15,000+ in rent while knowingly providing an uninhabitable property
4. Refusing to communicate or respond to messages during a health and safety crisis
5. **Never hiring a single licensed professional** despite months of requests
6. Endangering the health of **two minor children**
7. Leaving open, exposed construction areas for months with no completion

**This bad faith entitles me to recover attorney's fees, litigation costs, and enhanced damages under Georgia law.**

---

## IV. DAMAGES DEMANDED

I am entitled to full compensation for all damages caused by your breach and misconduct. The following is a detailed breakdown:

### A. Rent Abatement / Overpayment Refund

**Calculation:**
- Monthly contract rent: $3,000
- Reduced rental value due to loss of 2 bathrooms + mold: 60-70% reduction
- Months affected: May (partial), June, July, August, September = ~5 months

**Formula:** $3,000 × 0.60 × 5 months = **$9,000**

**Alternative calculation (aggressive):** $3,000 × 0.70 × 5 months = **$10,500**

**DEMAND: $10,500** (rent overpayment/abatement)

---

### B. Repair and Remediation Costs

I have obtained/will obtain estimates from licensed contractors for the following necessary work:

1. **Licensed plumber to repair upstairs bathroom leak:** $3,000
2. **Upstairs bathroom restoration (drywall, fixtures, finishes):** $5,000
3. **Downstairs bathroom complete restoration (ceiling, walls, floor):** $6,500
4. **Professional mold remediation (testing, removal, treatment, clearance):** $7,500
5. **Insulation replacement in affected areas:** $800
6. **Subflooring/structural repair if compromised:** $1,200
7. **HVAC duct cleaning (mold spore containment):** $500

**TOTAL REPAIR/REMEDIATION: $24,500**

---

### C. Security Deposit – Full Return

**Amount paid:** $[INSERT AMOUNT]

You have **no legal basis** to retain any portion of my security deposit because:
- All damage was caused by **your failure to repair** the leak

- The damage is the direct result of **your breach of duty**

**DEMAND: Full return of security deposit = $[INSERT AMOUNT]**

- Share a single bathroom
- Wake up earlier to coordinate bathroom time (disrupting children's school schedule)
- Endure stress, embarrassment, and anxiety

- Live in fear of mold health effects

**Quantified loss:**

**DEMAND: $5,000** (loss of use and quality of life)

- Avoid public court proceedings
- Avoid potential punitive damages
- Avoid damage to your reputation as a landlord

### Option 2: NEGOTIATE

## XII. CONCLUSION

I was a **model tenant** who paid you **$3,000 every month, on time, never late, always in full**. In return, you:

- ❌ Sent unqualified workers who made it worse
- ❌ Refused to hire licensed professionals despite repeated requests
- ❌ Left two bathrooms completely unusable for 5 months
- ❌ Exposed my children to black mold and health hazards
- ❌ Stopped responding to my messages
- ❌ Continued cashing my checks while providing an uninhabitable property
- ❌ Pocketed $15,000+ while spending $0 on proper repairs

**This is not a dispute about maintenance timelines or minor defects. This is about your willful exploitation of a good tenant and reckless endangerment of children.**

You have 15 days to make this right. After that, we go to court, and I will pursue every available remedy.

**The choice is yours.**
