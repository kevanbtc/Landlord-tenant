# BAD FAITH EVIDENCE TRACKER

**Case:** Yoda Burns v. Monisha [Last Name]  
**Purpose:** Document EVERY instance of landlord's bad faith, neglect, and willful disregard  
**Legal Basis:** O.C.G.A. § 13-6-11 (attorney's fees for bad faith)

---

## WHY BAD FAITH MATTERS

**Bad faith = Attorney's fees + Enhanced damages + Punitive relief**

Georgia law allows recovery of attorney's fees when defendant:
1. Acts in **bad faith**
2. Is **stubbornly litigious**
3. Causes **unnecessary trouble and expense**

Your landlord checks ALL THREE BOXES.

- **What he did:** Opened ceiling, looked around
- **What he SAID:** "I don't have the right tools" / "I'm not qualified" / "You need a plumber"

---

## CATEGORY 4: FAILED TO HIRE QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS

**Standard of care for responsible landlord:**

When notified of:
- ❌ Plumbing leak → Hire licensed plumber
- ❌ Water damage → Hire water damage restoration company
- ❌ Suspected mold → Hire certified mold remediation specialist
- ❌ Structural damage → Hire licensed contractor

**What this landlord did:**
- ✓ ZERO licensed professionals hired
- ✓ ZERO mold testing/remediation
- ✓ ZERO proper plumbing repair
- ✓ ZERO completion of any work

**Time period:** May - September = **5 MONTHS** of failing to meet basic duty

---

## CATEGORY 5: ENDANGERED CHILDREN'S HEALTH

**Two minor children (ages ~12 and 14) exposed to:**

1. **Black mold** - Respiratory hazard
   - Visible dark discoloration
   - Present for months
   - In actively occupied living space
   - Never tested or remediated
   - Landlord knew and ignored

2. **Water-damaged materials** - Bacterial/fungal growth
   - Wet drywall for months
   - Open ceiling cavities
   - Potential airborne contaminants
   - Landlord knew and ignored

3. **Unsanitary conditions**
   - Only 1 bathroom for family of 4
   - Children sharing single bathroom with parents for months
   - Exposed pipes and framing in living areas
   - Landlord knew and ignored

**BAD FAITH / RECKLESS DISREGARD:**
- Landlord knowingly subjected children to health hazards
- Continued for months despite clear reports
- No remediation efforts
- Potential basis for **intentional infliction of emotional distress** claim

---

## CATEGORY 6: REFUSED TO COMMUNICATE

**Document every instance of non-response:**

### September 1 (or beginning of month) Message
- **Your message:** [Summarize - likely explained ongoing conditions, requested timeline]
- **Landlord response:** **NONE**
- **Days elapsed with no response:** [Count them]
- **BAD FAITH:** Landlord went dark at critical juncture

### [Other instances of ignored messages]
- Date: [X]
  - Your message: [Summary]
  - Response: None
  - Days waited: [X]

### [Other instances of ignored messages]
- Date: [X]
  - Your message: [Summary]
  - Response: None
  - Days waited: [X]

**Pattern:** Landlord's strategy was to **ignore and hope problem goes away**

---

## CATEGORY 7: FAILED EPA/CDC/FEMA STANDARDS

**EPA/CDC/FEMA Mold Guidance (Industry Standard):**

- Water-damaged materials must be dried within **24-48 hours**
- Porous materials (drywall, insulation) that stay wet **must be removed**
- Mold remediation requires:
  - Containment (seal off affected area)
  - HEPA filtration
  - Removal of contaminated materials
  - Antimicrobial treatment
  - Clearance testing

**What landlord did:**
- ❌ No drying within 24-48 hours
- ❌ Let materials stay wet for MONTHS
- ❌ No containment
- ❌ No HEPA filtration
- ❌ No professional mold remediation
- ❌ No clearance testing
- ❌ No documentation of any protocol

**BAD FAITH / NEGLIGENCE:**
- Industry standards are publicly available
- Any reasonable landlord would know or research them
- Complete disregard = willful ignorance at best, reckless endangerment at worst

---

## CATEGORY 8: CONTINUED TO DEMAND PERFORMANCE WHILE BREACHING

**Landlord's Hypocrisy:**

| Landlord's Duty | Landlord's Performance |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Maintain habitable premises | ❌ Failed for 5 months |
| Make timely repairs | ❌ Never completed repairs |
| Provide safe environment | ❌ Left mold and damage |
| Respond to tenant concerns | ❌ Ignored messages |

| Tenant's Duty | Tenant's Performance |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Pay rent on time | ✅ **NEVER LATE** |
| Pay rent in full | ✅ **ALWAYS FULL $3,000** |
| Report issues | ✅ **MULTIPLE WRITTEN NOTICES** |
| Maintain property | ✅ **NO TENANT-CAUSED DAMAGE** |

**BAD FAITH:** Landlord demanded perfect performance while giving ZERO performance

---

## CATEGORY 9: WRONGFUL RETENTION OF SECURITY DEPOSIT

**If landlord attempts to keep any portion of security deposit:**

- Damage was **landlord-caused** (failed to fix leak → water damage → mold)
- Tenant **reported immediately**
- Tenant made **multiple requests for repair**
- Landlord's failure = landlord's liability

**Any attempt to claim tenant damage = ADDITIONAL BAD FAITH**

---

## CATEGORY 10: FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION

**The Math of Bad Faith:**

- Landlord received: **$15,000+ in rent** (May-Sept)
- Landlord spent on repairs: **$0** (no licensed professionals hired)
- Landlord's profit from breach: **$15,000**

**This is unjust enrichment:**
- Landlord kept full payment
- Landlord provided fraction of contracted value
- Landlord refused to remedy
- Landlord pocketed the difference

## LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF BAD FAITH

### Under O.C.G.A. § 13-6-11

**"The expenses of litigation generally shall not be allowed as a part of the damages; but where the plaintiff has specially pleaded and has made prayer therefor and where the defendant has acted in bad faith, has been stubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense, the jury may allow them."**

**Your Position:**
1. ✅ **Bad faith** - Documented above extensively
2. ✅ **Unnecessar trouble and expense** - 5 months of hell + litigation costs
3. ✅ **You can recover**: Attorney's fees + litigation costs + enhanced damages

### What This Means:
- Landlord pays YOUR attorney (or your time if pro se)
- Landlord pays court costs
- Landlord pays expert witness fees
- Landlord pays filing fees, service costs, etc.
- **This can add $10,000 - $20,000 to judgment**
