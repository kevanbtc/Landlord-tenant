## Value Accrual Mechanisms

### 1. Transaction Fees
- 0.3% fee on all Faith Chain transactions
- 50% burned (deflationary)
- 30% to stakers
- 20% to treasury

### 2. Gas Token
- FAITH required for gas on all Faith Chains
- Minimum balance requirement for validators
- Burned with every transaction

### 3. Staking Yields
- Lock FAITH to earn:
  - Transaction fee share (30%)
  - New emission rewards (decreasing)
  - Governance power (vote weight)

### 4. RWA Collateral
- FAITH required as collateral for RWA minting
- 150% collateralization ratio
- Liquidation mechanism creates buy pressure

### 5. Cross-Chain Fees
- Bridge usage requires FAITH payment
- 0.1% cross-chain transfer fee
- Burns 50%, distributes 50%

## Economic Security

### Anti-Whale Mechanics
- Max transaction: 0.1% of supply (1M FAITH)
- Graduated fees for large transfers
- Time-weighted voting (no instant governance)

### Deflationary Design
- Base burn: 0.15% per transaction
- RWA liquidation burns
- Validator slashing burns
- Target: 50% supply reduction in 10 years

### Price Stability Mechanisms
- Treasury buybacks during crashes
- Staking lockups reduce sell pressure
- Vested emissions prevent dumps
- Multi-chain liquidity prevents manipulation

## Growth Projections

### Conservative Model
- **Year 1**: 32M church members × $10 avg = $320M TVL
- **Year 2**: 100M users × $50 avg = $5B TVL
- **Year 3**: 500M users × $100 avg = $50B TVL

### Token Price Projections (Conservative)
- **Launch**: $0.10 (100M FDV)
- **Year 1**: $1.00 (1B FDV) - 10x
- **Year 2**: $5.00 (5B FDV) - 50x
- **Year 3**: $20.00 (20B FDV) - 200x
- **Year 5**: $100.00 (100B FDV) - 1000x

### Comparable Market Caps
- Ethereum: $400B
- BNB: $90B
- Polygon: $10B
- **FAITH Target**: $50-100B (Top 5 crypto)
