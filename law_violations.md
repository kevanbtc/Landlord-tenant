## 1. Georgia Statutory Duty to Repair – O.C.G.A. § 44-7-13

**Statute:**  
O.C.G.A. § 44-7-13 – Landlord must keep the premises in repair and is liable for substantial improvements made with consent.

**Requirement (Plain Language):**
- Landlord must maintain the property in good repair.
- In residential leases, this includes basic habitability: functional plumbing, safe and sanitary conditions.

**Violation (Facts Applied):**
- Landlord failed to repair an ongoing leak in the upstairs bathroom beginning mid-May 2025.
- Landlord allowed water to intrude into the downstairs bathroom ceiling and walls for months.
- Landlord sent only an unqualified handyman who tore out part of the ceiling but did not repair the plumbing or remediate damage.
- Landlord left both the upstairs children's bathroom and the downstairs guest bathroom unusable for months while continuing to accept full rent.

## 2. Implied Warranty of Habitability (Georgia Residential Leases)

**Principle:**
- Georgia treats residential leases as including an implied promise that the property will be fit for human habitation.
- Essential features like bathrooms and safe, non-moldy conditions are part of habitability.

**Violation:**
- Tenant and two minor children had only one functional bathroom (the master) for an extended period.
- Upstairs children's bathroom and downstairs guest bathroom were effectively unusable due to leak and risk of further damage.
- Suspected black mold and ongoing water damage in occupied areas undermined safe, sanitary living conditions.

---

## 3. Non-Waivable Duty to Repair (Georgia Case Law)

**Principle:**
- The landlord's statutory duty under O.C.G.A. § 44-7-13 cannot be waived by contract in residential leases.

**Violation:**
- Regardless of any lease language, Landlord remained responsible for:
  - Fixing plumbing.
  - Repairing water damage.
  - Restoring bathrooms to usable condition.
- Landlord failed to do so across several months despite repeated notice.

---

## 4. Constructive Eviction Doctrine (Georgia)

**Principle:**
- If a landlord's failure to repair makes the premises unfit for their intended use, the tenant can treat it as a **constructive eviction**.
- This can relieve the tenant of obligation to continue paying rent and justify early termination.

**Violation (Applied):**
- Two critical bathrooms out of service for months.
- Water damage and suspected mold in a main bathroom and living area.
- Landlord's non-repair substantially deprived Tenant of full use and enjoyment of the home.
- Tenant was effectively forced to choose between:
  - Living with unsafe, unhealthy conditions; or
  - Moving out early.

## 5. Georgia "Safe at Home" Act (HB 404 – Habitability Standards)

**Principle:**
- Recent Georgia changes (HB 404) reinforce that rental housing must meet minimum habitability standards, including health and safety.

**Violation:**
- Water-damaged, mold-prone conditions in occupied areas.
- Lack of functional children's bathroom and guest bathroom.
- Failure to timely remedy known health and safety issues after notice.

---

## 6. General Negligence – Standard of Care for Repairs

**Duty:**
- Landlord must act with reasonable care in maintaining property.
- When notified of leaks and potential mold, a reasonable landlord:
  - Engages qualified professionals.
  - Remediates water damage promptly (typically within 24–48 hours).
  - Protects occupants from exposure.

**Breach:**
- Landlord delayed meaningful action for months.
- Sent an unqualified handyman:
  - Opened ceiling, left damage exposed.
  - Did not fix leak.
  - Did not remediate water-damaged or mold-contaminated materials.

**Harm:**
- Tenant and children exposed to possible mold.
- Loss of two bathrooms.
- Ongoing disruption and diminished value of tenancy.

## 7. Mold and Water Intrusion – National Guidance (EPA/CDC/FEMA)

> These are not Georgia statutes, but they define the **standard of care** and what a competent landlord should know.

**Key Guidance (Summary):**
- Building materials that stay wet more than 24–48 hours are likely to grow mold.
- Water-damaged porous materials (drywall, ceiling tiles, insulation, some wood) often must be removed and replaced.
- Visible mold and persistent moisture require professional remediation, especially in living spaces.

**Deviation from Standard:**
- Landlord allowed water intrusion and damage to persist for **months**.
- No documented drying protocol, containment, or professional removal.
- Tenant reports visible staining and suspected black mold in an actively used area (downstairs bathroom).

---

## 8. Retention of Rent for Uninhabitable Conditions

**Principle:**
- When essential parts of a dwelling are unusable, the **rental value is reduced**.
- Continuing to charge full rent for substantially uninhabitable or partially unusable premises can support:
  - Claims for rent abatement.
  - Claims for refund of rent already paid.

**Application to Facts:**
- Landlord accepted full $3,000/month rent while:
  - Upstairs children's bathroom was unusable.
  - Downstairs guest bathroom was unusable.
  - Mold/water damage persisted for months.
- The property delivered was worth significantly less than the contracted value during this period.

---

## 9. Security Deposit Handling (General Georgia Framework)

**Principle:**
- A landlord cannot use the security deposit to compensate themselves for conditions caused by their own failure to repair or maintain premises.
- Security deposit is typically for:
  - Unpaid rent.
  - Excess damage caused by tenant (beyond normal wear and tear).

**Violation (Potential):**
- If Landlord attempts to keep security deposit despite:
  - Landlord-caused or landlord-neglected damage (leak, mold, incomplete repairs).
  - Tenant's full payment of rent and non-fault in the damage.
- Deposit should be returned in full.

---

## 10. Bad Faith / Expenses of Litigation – O.C.G.A. § 13-6-11

**Principle:**
- Georgia allows a plaintiff to recover attorney's fees and litigation expenses where the defendant has:
  - Acted in bad faith, or
  - Been stubbornly litigious, or
  - Caused unnecessary trouble and expense.

**Application:**
- Landlord ignored multiple written notices over several months.
- Landlord used unqualified labor and never completed repairs.
- Tenant was forced to seek legal relief and build a full evidentiary case to obtain basic habitability and financial redress.

---

## Notes

- Georgia's landlord duty and habitability principles are rooted in O.C.G.A. § 44-7-13 and related case law.
- Recent "Safe at Home" changes codify minimum habitability expectations.
- Mold and water intrusion standards (24–48 hour rule, removal of wet porous materials) are drawn from EPA/CDC/FEMA guidance.
