# DAMAGES MAXIMIZER – Every Dollar Recoverable

**Case:** Yoda Burns v. Monisha [Last Name]  
**Property:** 3530 Patterstone Drive, Alpharetta, GA  
**Strategy:** Pursue EVERY available damages category to maximum extent

---

## FOUNDATIONAL LEVERAGE POINTS

### Your Strengths (Bulletproof Position)
1. **Perfect payment record** - Never missed a payment, never late, always full $3,000
2. **Multiple written notices** - Created clear paper trail showing landlord's knowledge
3. **Landlord's own handyman** - Admitted on-site that he wasn't qualified and needed a plumber
4. **Months of inaction** - May to September = 4-5 months of documented neglect
5. **Continued accepting rent** - Landlord took $15,000+ while knowing property was uninhabitable
6. **Two minor children** - Health and safety factors amplify damages

---

## TIER 1: DIRECT MONETARY DAMAGES (Calculable & Provable)

### 1. Rent Abatement / Overpayment Recovery

**Philosophy:** You paid for a 3-bathroom home. You got a 1-bathroom home with mold.

**Base Calculation:**
- Contract rent: $3,000/month
- Actual usable value: ~40-50% (lost 2/3 bathrooms + mold hazard)
- **Reduction factor: 50-60%**

**Timeline Breakdown:**

| Month | Rent Paid | Reduced Value | Overpayment |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| May 2025 (partial - last 2 weeks) | $1,500 | $750 | **$750** |
| June 2025 (full month) | $3,000 | $1,200 | **$1,800** |
| July 2025 (full month) | $3,000 | $1,200 | **$1,800** |
| August 2025 (full month) | $3,000 | $1,200 | **$1,800** |
| September 2025 (full month) | $3,000 | $1,200 | **$1,800** |
| **TOTALS** | **$13,500** | **$5,550** | **$7,950** |

**Rent Abatement Demand: $7,950** (conservative at 60% reduction)

**Alternative Aggressive Calculation (70% reduction):**
- 5 months × $3,000 × 0.70 = **$10,500**

**Recommendation:** Demand $10,500, settle for no less than $7,500.

---

### 3. Security Deposit – 100% Return

**Why you get FULL RETURN:**
- Damage was landlord-caused (failed to repair leak)
- You reported immediately and repeatedly
- Landlord's neglect created the mold and water damage
- You cannot be charged for landlord's breach of duty

**NO DEDUCTIONS PERMITTED.**

---

- Moving company or truck rental: **$800 - $1,500**
- Packing materials: **$150**
- Time off work for move: **$[Calculate hourly wage × hours]**
- Utility connection/disconnection fees: **$200**
- Address change costs: **$100**
- Storage if needed between moves: **$[Calculate]**

**Estimated demand: $2,000 - $3,000**

---

### 5. Temporary Housing Costs (If Applicable)

**If you had to get temporary housing BEFORE moving out:**
- Hotel or short-term rental costs
- Additional living expenses
- **Document and include**

---

### 6. Lost Personal Property

**Did water damage or mold affect any of YOUR belongings?**

---

### 8. Loss of Use / Quality of Life Damages

**This is where you quantify the daily hell:**

#### Daily Disruption Value
- 4 people, 1 bathroom, 4-5 months
- Children's education disrupted (late to school due to bathroom crowding)
- Inability to host family/friends due to embarrassment
- Stress, anxiety, loss of peaceful enjoyment

**Formula:**
- Per diem rate: $50/day (conservative)
- 150 days (5 months): **$7,500**

**Alternative calculation:**
- 10% of monthly rent × 5 months = $1,500
- But given TWO CHILDREN and severe disruption, argue for 20-25%
- 25% × $3,000 × 5 = **$3,750**

**Demand: $5,000 minimum**

---

### 9. Utilities Overpayment

**You paid utilities for a 3-bathroom home while only using 1 bathroom:**
- Water/sewer charges for service you couldn't use
- Calculate if you can show reduced usage but same charges
- **Estimated: $200 - $400**

---

## TIER 2: PUNITIVE & PENALTY DAMAGES

2. Sent unqualified handyman after being told he wasn't qualified
3. Continued cashing $3,000 checks knowing property was uninhabitable
4. Never responded to beginning-of-month demands
5. Refused to hire licensed professionals despite clear need
6. Left open, exposed ceiling for months
7. No mold remediation despite visible black mold
